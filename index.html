        <h2>I am learning Code :)</h2>
        <pre>I am originally from close to Frankfurt and after studying economics (at Justus-Liebig-University) I worked at a bank. 
          Quite quickly I realized though, that this would not be my journey. 
          So, I built up my self-employment in the advertising industry parallel to my job. 
          After one year I was able to leave the bank and have been self-employed for almost 8 years now. 
          I have always loved contradictions which is why I developed a sport: 
          BurningBalance, which is a combination of fitness and yoga, tension and relief. 
          In addition, I was able to publish my book about it. Coding is now the next exciting challenge I am taking up. 
          I am curious to see which opportunities are going to open up after finishing the Le Wagon bootcamp. 
          On the weekends you can find me in the mountains, skiing or trailing. And of course on the farm with my pony. 
          After the bootcamp I will be receiving a puppy which I am already excited about.</pre>
